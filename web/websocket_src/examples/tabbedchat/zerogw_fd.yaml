# This is example of configuration file with listening socket passed by
# file descriptor. It's useful to bind to port 80 either using openport or
# using procboss, and to run multiple instances of zerogw on single port
# (see single_socket.sh)

# Zerogw's configuration library allows you to override variables
# from a command line, so we create one, to be able to override port and socket
# directory. See ./scale.sh for example of how to use it
# (we use yaml anchors and $-style variables interchangeably with coyaml)
