Tabbed Chat Example
===================

Running::

    ./start.sh

You can also try::

    ./scale.sh

Which runs multiple processes of python and zerogw, to show how it could be
scaled. But you need to turn sockets into tcp ones to scale it to multiple
machines, and also fix redis config which is awfully slow for testing purposes.

There is also::

    ./single_socket.sh

Which is merely same as ``scale.sh``, but running multiple zerogw instances
on single port.
